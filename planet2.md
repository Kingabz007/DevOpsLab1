Fomalhaut b, formally named Dagon (/ˈdeɪɡən/),[2] is a former candidate planet observed near the A-type main-sequence star Fomalhaut, approximately 25 light-years away in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus. The object's discovery was initially announced in 2008 and confirmed in 2012 via images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. Under the working hypothesis that the object was a planet, it was reported in January 2013[3][4] that it had a highly elliptical orbit with a period of 1,700 Earth years.[5] The object was one of those selected by the International Astronomical Union as part of NameExoWorlds, their public process for giving proper names to exoplanets.[6][7] The process involved public nomination and voting for the new name.[8] In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Dagon.
